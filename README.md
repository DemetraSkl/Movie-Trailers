##Project: Movie Trailer Website

This project showcases my favorite movies, including their title, box art and YouTube links to movie trailers. 

**Installation Requirements**

All Python files (entertainment_center.py, media.py, fresh_tomatoes.py) must be saved in the same file directory for the code to run properly. 

Code can be run in Python 2.7 versions that can be downloaded from the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Open the downloaded file and follow the Python Installer steps. IDLE is a program that is installed by Python that will allow you to edit or run the code. You can search for IDLE in your Applications (Mac users) or All Programs (Windows users) folder once the installation is complete. 

**Usage**
To open the movie trailer website, open and run the entertainment_center.py module using IDLE. This module instantiates movie objects by calling the constructor media.Movie() and creates an HTML file that loads on your default webbrowser. 

**Relative links**
fresh_tomatoes.py can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode)

The project details were prescribed by [Udacityâ€™s Programming Foundations with Python](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud036) course.
